## __Current Research__  
---
My current research focuses on mechanisms of protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination.


## __Previous Research__  
---

Our final goal is to figure out the function and mechanism of important genes related to those  production traits, apparent traits, or disease-resistant traits of chicken, such as *MSTN*, *TYR*, *DMRT1*, and *HEMGN*, and to genetically improve the traits of chicken.  

The lack of efficient methods to generate gene-modified chicken delayed chicken gene expression and function research, till CRISPR/Cas genome editing system casts light into this field. My research focused on chicken genome editing using adenoviral CRISPR/Cas vector. Moreover, I developed an efficient and accurate method based on amplicon sequencing for analyzing CRISPR-induced mutations.

* __Chicken Leg Muscle *In Vivo* *MSTN* Gene Knockout  through Direct Injection of Adenoviral CRISPR-Cas9 Vector__  
Nov 2017 - Jun 2018  
Bachelor Thiesis, advisor: Prof. He Meng   
Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center of Agri-Seeds, SJTU   
    * Large-fragment deletion of *MSTN* was detected in all KO group chicken, and the expression of *MSTN* was downregulated. Enrichment and IPA analysis revealed the interaction of *MSTN*.  
    * Reviewer commented: it is a *sound methodology* for gene function and mechanism studies in avian species  


* __Chicken *TYR* Gene Knockout through Dorsal Aorta Direct Injection of Adenoviral CRISPR/Cas9 Vector__   
Jul 2018 - Dec 2021  
Master Thesis, advisor: Prof. He Meng   
Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center of Agri-Seeds, SJTU  
     * *TYR* knockout was detected both in chicken embryos and living G0 chimera chicken  
* __High Precision and Cost-efficient Detection of CRISPR-induced Low-frequency Indels based on Amplicon Sequencing__  
Aug 2020 - Nov 2021
Master Thesis, advisor: Prof. He Meng  
Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center of Agri-Seeds, SJTU  
    * Conventional CRISPR-induced indel detection methods could no longer meet the evolving requirements of CRISPR biology
    * Could become a better choice for CRISPR-indeuced low-frequency indel detection especially for those tight-budget and labor-shortage labs  


* __Chicken *MSTN* and *TYR* Gene Knockout through Jugular Vein Direct Injection of Adenoviral CRISPR/Cas9 Vector__   
Sep 2020 - Dec 2021, advisor: Prof. He Meng

    * Gene knockout was detected in multiple KO group chicken tissues
    * Provided a new method for chicken genome editing and showed several important features of it
