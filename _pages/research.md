## __Current Research__  
---
My current research focuses on mechanisms of protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination.


## __Previous Research__  
---
My thesis research is advised by Prof. [He Meng](http://www.agri.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Data/View/2947) at Shanghai Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, SJTU.  

The direction is animal genome engineering. Our final goal is to figure out the function and mechanism of several important genes related to the production traits, apparent traits, or disease-resistant traits of chicken, such as *MSTN*, *TYR*, *DMRT1*, and *HEMGN*, and to genetically improve the traits of chicken.  

The lack of efficient methods to generate gene-modified chicken delayed chicken gene expression and function research, till CRISPR/Cas genome editing system casts light into this field. My recent research is chicken genome editing using adenoviral CRISPR/Cas vector. I focus on *MSTN* and *TYR* genes related to muscle development and melanin synthesis respectively. Moreover, I developed an efficient and accurate method based on amplicon sequencing for analyzing CRISPR-induced mutations.

### __Project 1__  
__Chicken Leg Muscle *In Vivo* *MSTN* Gene Knockout  through Direct Injection of Adenoviral CRISPR-Cas9 Vector__  
Bachelor dissertation, *Nov 2017 - Jun 2018*  
One SCI / Two conference abstracts / One conference oral presentation
* Previous findings about the regulatory mechanisms of chicken muscle growth and development were not clear
* We performed *in vivo MSTN* gene knockout on broiler leg muscle through direct injection of adenoviral Cas9 vector, and used Sanger sequencing, and RNA-seq to analyze
* Large-fragment deletion of *MSTN* was detected in all KO group chicken, and the expression of *MSTN* was downregulated. Enrichment and IPA analysis revealed many genes that interacted with *MSTN*.  
* Reviewer commented: it is a *sound methodology* for gene function and mechanism studies in avian species

### __Project 2__  
__Chicken *TYR* Gene Knockout through Dorsal Aorta Direct Injection of Adenoviral CRISPR/Cas9 Vector__   
Master dissertation, *Jul 2018 - Dec 2021*  
One SCI in progress
* Previous findings about regulatory mechanisms of chicken melanin systhesis and accumulation were not clear
* We performed *in ovo TYR* gene knockout on Dongxiang black chicken through embryonic dorsal aorta injection of adenoviral Cas9 vector, and used amplicon sequencing to analyze
* *TYR* knockout was detected both in chicken embryos and living G0 chimera chicken blood
* Now we are screening F1 offsprings aiming to generate homozygous offspring

### __Project 3__  
__Efficient and Accurate Method Based on Amplicon Sequencing for Analyzing CRISPR-induced Mutations__  
*Aug 2020 - Nov 2021*  
One SCI submitted / One conference oral presentation / One conference e-poster / One Chinese patent  
* For CRISPR-induced mutations analysis, traditional methods could no longer meet the evolving requirements while NGS methods cost much 
* We developed an efficient and accurate method based on amplicon sequencing to analyzing CRISPR-induced mutations
* Our method was far more efficient and accurate than traditional methods and cost far less money and time. Meanwhile, it provided well-visualized results
* Our method could become a better choice for CRISPR-indeuced mutations analysis especially for those tight-budget and labor-shortage labs

### __Project 4__  
__Chicken *MSTN* and *TYR* Gene Knockout through Jugular Vein Direct Injection of Adenoviral CRISPR/Cas9 Vector__  
*Sep 2020 - Dec 2021*  
One SCI in progress
* Previous chicken genome editing methods were not effcient and simple enough
* We injected adenoviral CRISPR/Cas vector into jugular vein of postnatal chicken for *MSTN* and *TYR* knockout on Liyang chicken, and used amplicon sequencing to analyze
* Gene knockout was detected in multiple KO group chicken tissues especially liver, spleen and chest muscle
* Our research provided a new method for chicken genome editing and showed several important features of it

### __Project 5__  
__Transcriptomic Analysis of *MSTN* Knockout in the Early Differentiation of Chicken Fetal Myoblasts__  
*Nov 2019 - Jul 2021*  
One SCI

* Previous findings about the regulatory mechanisms of chicken muscle growth and development were not clear
* We performed *MSTN* gene knockout on chicken fetal myoblasts, and used RNA-seq to analyze
* The IPA analysis revealed a novel *MSTN* signaling pathway which is inconsistant with mammals and consistent with *MSTN* knockout chicken leg muscles. We speculated that this pathway may be a unique regulatory pathway for *MSTN* in birds
* Our research provided valuable evidence for understanding avian *MSTN* regulation mechanism

__Liver Cancer Modeling in Mice using CRISPR/Cas System__  
Advisor: A.P. Shun Li, *Jun 2017 – Aug 2017*  
Experimental Animals Department, Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center, Fudan University, Shanghai, China  
One SCI review / One Chinese core
* Constructed Cas9-mMad2 and Cpf1-mP53 vectors based on pX330 for generating gene knockout mice
* Collected mice blood and detected potential liver cancer in gene-modified mice
* Moreover, determined Zika virus (ZIKV) TCID50 on 3T3 cells and extracted RNA from ZIKV for genotyping

Shanghai Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, SJTU  
One SCI
* Isolated live mice sperm from its epididymis, cultured sperm with Cd and different kinds of antioxidants
* Determined the activity of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase by Western blotting and IHC
* Our research revealed that vitamin C exerts protective effects against cadmium toxicity in mice sperm by inducing the dephosphorylation of dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenasethe
