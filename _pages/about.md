Chengxiao (Rex) Han <img src="/images/rexhanname.jpg" style="height: 25px;vertical-align: middle" title="photographed by Yulin Liao">

I am a PhD student at [Protein Synthesis Lab](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/panlab?lang=en) at SJTU advised by [Prof. Man Pan](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/panlab/people?lang=en).   

My current research focuses on mechanisms of protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination. 

I received my MS (2021) and BS (2018) in Animal Science from SJTU advised by [Prof. He Meng](https://www.agri.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Data/View/2947).
