I am a doctoral student at [Protein Synthesis Lab](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/panlab?lang=en) at SJTU advised by Dr. [Man Pan](https://www.x-mol.com/groups/panlab/people?lang=en).   

My current research focuses on mechanisms of protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination. 

I received my MS (2021) and BS (2018) in Animal Science from SJTU advised by Prof. [He Meng](https://www.agri.sjtu.edu.cn/En/Data/View/2947). I served as an officer at Institute of Translational Medicine / Special Construction Office, SJTU from Jan 2022 to Aug 2022.
