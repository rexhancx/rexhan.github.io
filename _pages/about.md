## __About Me__  
---
I am Chengxiao (Rex) Han <img src="/images/rexhanname.jpg" style="height: 25px;vertical-align: middle">. I received my MSc and BSc in Animal Science at School of Agriculture and Biology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China. Currently I am working for Special Construction Office, Institute of Translational Medicine, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.  

My current research interests lie at: (1) genome editing using CRISPR/Cas system, (2) structure basis of protein interactions and (3) development and application of advanced biotechnology to solve life science problems.   

I am passionate about my research career and very open to collaborate with others.
